      @misc{Hough_1962, place={United States}, title={METHOD AND MEANS FOR RECOGNIZING COMPLEX PATTERNS}, abstractNote={This patent relates to a method and means for recognizing a complex pattern in a picture.  The picture is divided into framelets, each framelet being sized so that any segment of the complex pattern therewithin is essentially a straight line. Each framelet is scanned to produce an electrical pulse for each point scanned on the segment therewithin. Each of the electrical pulses of each segment is then transformed into a separate strnight line to form a plane transform in a pictorial display. Each line in the plane transform of a segment is positioned laterally so that a point on the line midway between the top and the bottom of the pictorial display occurs at a distance from the left edge of the pictorial display equal to the distance of the generating point in the segment from the left edge of the framelet. Each line in the plane transform of a segment is inclined in the pictorial display at an angle to the vertical whose tangent is proportional to the vertical displacement of the generating point in the segment from the center of the framelet. The coordinate position of the point of intersection of the lines in the pictorial display for each segment is determined and recorded. The sum total of said recorded coordinate positions being representative of the complex pattern. (AEC)}, author={Hough, P.V.C.}, year={1962}, month={Dec}}

      abstract = {Automatic image annotation techniques that try to identify the objects in images usually need the images to be segmented first, especially when specifically annotating image regions. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different objects in images from each other, so that objects can be processed as integral individuals. Therefore, annotation performance is highly influenced by the effectiveness of segmentation. Unfortunately, automatic segmentation is a difficult problem, and most of the current segmentation techniques do not guarantee good results. A multiple segmentations algorithm is proposed by Russell et al. [12] to discover objects and their extent in images. In this paper, we explore the novel use of multiple segmentations in the context of image auto-annotation. It is incorporated into a region based image annotation technique proposed in previous work, namely the training image based feature space approach. Three different levels of segmentations were generated for a 5000 image collection. Experimental results show that image auto-annotation achieves better performance when using all three segmentation levels together than using any single one on its own.},

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/ smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.},

In the first part, a set of candidate maneuvers is generated to track a given path. Each candidate differs in speed and in lateral offset to the tracked path. Thus, the USV has the option to change speeds or switch "lanes", or do both. In the second part, the most appropriate trajectory is selected for execution. High priority objectives, such as safety clearance, are represented quantitatively as rules. Candidate maneuvers that flout any of these rules are immediately rejected. Lower priority objectives, such as minimizing travel time, are represented as a priority list of selection criteria. From the remaining candidates, an iterative process of short listing maneuvers is performed. At each step, a single criterion is used to rank and select the top trajectories. The process is repeated for criteria of decreasing priority until only one maneuvers remains. The presented solution has been implemented and tested in simulation. Some of these simulation results will be presented.},

      abstract = {The use of unmanned vehicles in the field of underwater and marine applications is increasing significantly in recent years. Autonomous vehicles (like AUVs and gliders) or teleoperated ones (like ROVs) are currently employed for executing a number of different underwater tasks, like inspecting submerged pipes, executing maintenance interventions on underwater gas- or oil-platforms, collecting environmental or oceanographic data, performing surveys on sites of archeological interest. In parallel with the development of underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), are they also witnessing an increasing interest from the robotic community, especially with the goal of performing surveillance applications, like patrolling and maintaining safeguarded against intruders harbours or other ldquocrucialrdquo sites. The potential benefits offered by automated vessels equipped with sensors such as cameras or sonars are quite evident, since they could be used to quickly identify the level of menace of unknown radar track without exposing any human operators to possible threats. However USVs, unlike in the underwater case, have to face the problem of avoiding other vessels which in most cases are manned ones. This is a crucial point especially in that kind of application, where the automated vessel has to move quickly towards a possible menace while at the same time avoiding all the other boats normally operating in the harbour area. Unfortunately, at the current state of art, a reliable methodology to avoid the other vessels and the availability of effective and accurate obstacle detection sensors is still missing. This paper focus its attention on the case of USV used for security applications within a harbour, devising a solution that can be real-time implemented for the obstacle avoidance problem under critical situations where the vehicle as to reach its target as fast as possible while guaranteeing the safety of the other vessels. The presented solution is based on- a three layered hierarchical architecture: the first layer computes a global path taking into account static obstacles known a priori, the second layer modifies this path in a locally optimal way (under certain assumptions) exploiting kinematic data of the moving obstacles, while the last layer reactively avoids obstacles for which such data is not available. The paper was therefore organized as follows: in the first section an introduction and state of art are presented, in the successive section the work discussed the first layer and the methods for the static obstacles avoidance, while in the third the paper focused on the moving obstacles and the proposed avoidance algorithm, while also presenting many different detailed simulation results regarding the performances achievable by the overall architecture. Finally a concluding section also indicate some still open problems and future work directions to be developed.},

      abstract = {This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the 'stand-on' vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.

      abstract = {This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the 'stand-on' vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.

      abstract = {The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego has been involved in the continuing development of obstacle avoidance for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) towards the aim of a high level of autonomous navigation. An autonomous USV can fulfill a variety of missions and applications that are of increasing interest for the US Navy and other Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security organizations. The USV obstacle avoidance package is being developed first by accurately creating a world model based on various sensors such as vision, radar, and nautical charts. Then, with this world model the USV can avoid obstacles with the use of a far-field deliberative obstacle avoidance component and a near-field reactive obstacle avoidance component. This paper addresses the advances made in USV obstacle avoidance during the last two years.},

      abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for online path planning of USVs to navigate safely in dynamic, sophisticated environments of oceans. The proposed algorithm is based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) which integrated with Velocity Obstacle (VO) approach. MILP is an optimization method under multiple constraint conditions of objective function maximization or minimization. The constraints of environment and maneuverability all can be considered and appended to the constraints conditions expressed in the form of inequality. The objective function and constraint conditions are required in linear by MILP, however, the motion of USV and its path planning are nonlinear. So the principle problem is to transform the nonlinear problem into the linear problem. On the other hand, VO makes a linear prediction, which is well appended into the constraint conditions. MILP has advantages in astringency, optimization, real-time and VO also has the advantages in real-time. The combination of MILP and VO utilized the advantages of rapidity of computations, which is well suited for embedded system of robotic applications. The algorithm is demonstrated via simulation with more safety and acclimation in sophisticated environments of oceans.},
