@inproceedings{Achanta2009,
abstract = {Detection of visually salient image regions is useful for applications like object segmentation, adaptive compression, and object recognition. In this paper, we introduce a method for salient region detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps with well-defined boundaries of salient objects. These boundaries are preserved by retaining substantially more frequency content from the original image than other existing techniques. Our method exploits features of color and luminance, is simple to implement, and is computationally efficient. We compare our algorithm to five state-of-the-art salient region detection methods with a frequency domain analysis, ground truth, and a salient object segmentation application. Our method outperforms the five algorithms both on the ground-truth evaluation and on the segmentation task by achieving both higher precision and better recall.},

abstract = {Abstract- This work presents the integration of obstacle detection and analysis capabilities in a coherent and advanced C{\&}C framework allowing mixed-mode control in unmanned surface systems. The collision avoidance work has been successfully integrated in an operational autonomous surface vehicle and demonstrated in real operational conditions. We present the collision avoidance system, the ROAZ autonomous surface vehicle and the results obtained at sea tests. Limitations of current COTS radar systems are also discussed and further research directions are proposed towards the development and integration of advanced collision avoidance systems taking in account the different requirements in unmanned surface vehicles},
